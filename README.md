# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This week I had to create a weather dashboard to search the weather for a city. The website will call on information from an api to display the current days weather as well as a five day forecast.

Upon loading the webpage, you can search for any city's weather.

After clicking the search button, you are then presented with the current day's weather as well as the five day forecast. An icon visualizes the type of the weather (i.e. cloudy, sunny, rainy, snowy).

A button is created with every search in order to store information in local storage. I was unable to retrieve that city's weather information with the city's button click.
